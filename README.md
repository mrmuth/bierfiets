# Massaging our bike route data

The original data in this repository are the `.gpx` files.

Our aim is to facilitate their sloshing back and forth between
GPX and GeoJSON, because the former is the source and ultimate
destination (onboard a handlebar-mounted GPS receiver) while the
latter is a more convenient form in which to work with, extend,
and refine the data.
